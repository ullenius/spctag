Codes for Emulators used to dump SPC-files
==========================================
Compiled by A. Ullenius

THe "Emulator used for dumping"-value is set by 1 byte-flag. In two different 
offset locations depending on if SPC is using binary or text-format for 
storing the ID666-tag.

Binary offset:	0xD1
Text offset:	0xD2


There are several versions of the SPC-specification. The most recent I've found
 is v0.31.

And there's also this Japanese website (dated 2008/12/04) that has a more 
extensive document on the ID666-format. Note: Japan uses YYYY-mm-dd

* The v0.31 spec only mentions 2 emulator values
* The Japanese doc mentions a lot more

ID666 TEXT format
---------------------
Emulator type: 
0x30 = Unknown, 
0x31 = ZSNES, 
0x32 = Snes9x, 
0x33 = ZST2SPC, 
0x34 = Other, 
0x35 = SNEShout, 
0x36 = ZSNES / W,
0x37 = Snes9xpp,
0x38 = SNESGT


ID 666 BINARY format
--------------------
Emulator type: 
0x00 = Unknown,
0x01 = ZSNES, 
0x02 = Snes9x, 
0x03 = ZST2SPC,
0x04 = Other,
0x05 = SNEShout,
0x06 = ZSNES / W,
0x07 = Snes9xpp,
